    <h2>Where I Stand</h2>
    <p class="platform-page-intro">
      Arizona families are being priced out of their own communities. Why? Because corporate interests and out-of-state developers have shaped policies that benefit the wealthy few while hardworking Arizonans struggle to get by.
    </p>
    <p class="platform-page-intro">
      I'm running to put Arizona families first—not special interests or corporate donors.
    </p>

      We deserve leaders who are clear about where they stand. Here is my platform.

      Most importantly, I want to hear from you as this platform grows and develops. Please reach out to info@ericstaffordforsenate.com with any thoughts or additions you might have, or to schedule a further conversation.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Arizona stands at a crossroads. Our state is growing rapidly, but that growth isn't benefiting everyone equally. While corporations rake in record profits, working families face skyrocketing housing costs, water insecurity, and an education system that's been systematically underfunded for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need a government that works for Arizona families, not one beholden to special interests. My platform addresses the real challenges facing our communities, from securing our water future to making housing affordable, from protecting our environment to ensuring every child gets a quality education.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be a Senator for all Arizonans—not just those who can afford to buy influence in Washington.
