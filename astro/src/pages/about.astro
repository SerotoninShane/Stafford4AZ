    <div class="about-content">
        <p>Eric Stafford is a community organizer, small business advocate, and lifelong Arizonan running for U.S. Senate to deliver <strong>progress and prosperity</strong>  to all by rejecting special interests and legislating with integrity.</p>

        <p>A born-and-raised Arizonan, Eric's path reflects his commitment to service and results. His blue-collar experience began when he earned his <strong>Airframe & Powerplant License</strong> and worked as a certified Airplane Mechanic & Machinist. This work gave him firsthand insight into the struggles of working families and the need for greater workplace justice.</p>

        <p>Eric's dedication to an ethical, human-first approach was cemented by personal tragedy: watching his own mother suffer permanent brain damage because the <strong>inflated cost of medicine</strong> due to corporate greed made her life-saving treatment unaffordable. This injustice fuels his fight for affordable healthcare and against corporate price gouging.</p>

        <p>From organizing neighbors to save long-time residents from corporate developers, to bringing together ranchers, tribal leaders, and environmental advocates on <strong>water conservation</strong>, Eric believes results matter more than party loyalty. He has dedicated his energy to a team of progress for all Arizonans, pushing for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Fully funding public schools and supporting teachers to reverse crippling system debt.</li>
            <li><strong>Labor:</strong> Ensuring essential workers earn a living wage and restoring benefits for a stable middle class.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Proactively preserving groundwater, maintaining aquifers, and improving air quality.</li>
        </ul> <br>

        <p>Eric Stafford is prepared to be a fearless leader who rejects dark money, prioritizes his constituents, and brings a pragmatic approach to creating a government that truly works for all Americans.</p>
